# Decimal to Binary in Javascript

This repository solves the kata problem of converting a base 10 number to a base 2 number
in javascript. Jest was used as the test framework.

Before running the tests use the command "npm install --save-dev jest" to install the test framework.
Once that's done you can run the tests and see the convert function in action with the command "npm test".
